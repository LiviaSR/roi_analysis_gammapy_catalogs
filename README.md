# roi_analysis_gammapy_catalogs
A Python code to search for possible Î³-ray counterparts to the target source and to perform the spectral model fitting. This code selects the sources (in the Gammapy source catalogs) within the region of interest (centered in the position of the target source) and finds the best fit for the given spectrum model.
